# METIS_Simulations
This repository contains Scripts for simulating METIS data with ScopeSim.

In particular, simulations for
* The METIS-PIP delivery to ESO.
* To develop/test/validate the pipeline.
* Science case simulations (future work). 

These can overlap, but don't necessarily have too.

The idea is to store the (Python) scripts to create the simulations in this repository, not the simulated data itself.

You can find [instructions on running the Simulations scripts here](https://github.com/AstarVienna/METIS_Simulations/tree/karr/updateREADME/Simulations)

[There are some scripts for manipulating files into ESO compliant files here](https://github.com/AstarVienna/METIS_Simulations/tree/karr/updateREADME/fitsWrangler), these have been mostly superceded by the pervious simulation scripts, and are kept for reference. 


- None of these cases have been simulated with SimMETIS, input data are heterogeneous some come obviously from simulations some are observations from other instruments given only as example but are not simulated METIS observations. It is unclear how suitable they are as input for ScopeSim for our purpose.
